# Sharky-Explorer
A basic but extremly fast and efficient file explorer writen in rust 

As of now there is no functionality except navigation and searching files i plan to have a full but minimal and fast explorer soon

This isnt really meant for just anyone to use feel free to contribute its just a learning project for me
